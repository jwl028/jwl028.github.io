The one day I had ramen in New York that one time I went to New York.

It was nothing like we had imagined. Subzero temperatures were completely foreign to us outside of a chemistry classroom. We happened to be visiting New York City on one of the coldest weekends this past February. *And yet we trekked.* From 53rd St. and 5th Ave, we trekked through Central Park all the way to the American Museum of Natural History while withstanding 20 mph winds.

After our trip to the museum we headed to the ever-so-popular Totto Ramen. We arrived 10 minutes after their opening time for dinner and already there was a crowd at the door. Upon seeing the crowd, my first instinct was to head elsewhere. It was beyond freezing and I was inadequently dressed for standing outside for such a long period. However, with a tent outside the restaurant, I decided it should provide sufficient protection from the weather for the next half hour or so. I walked in the tent, through the crowd of patrons huddling on the door steps, and signed my name on the half-filled waitlist, "Jimmy 2". And there we were, standing a few steps from the restaurant, committed to entering the establishment for a moderately sized bowl of steamy hot ramen noodles. By the way, **it was still cold**.

###Should we wait or should we go? *That was the big question*
With each passing minute, I felt greater levels of discomfort. Not knowing exactly how long the wait was going to be made it an even more grueling experience. So I had two options:

1. Wait in the cold for x minutes to get highly rated noodles.
2. Seek shelter elsewhere and immediately feel warmth and full.

Going through this thought process reminds me of the dilemma I face while lifting on a daily basis. To go with option 1 is similar to grinding out those last couple reps on your deadlifts. It will feel like eternity and you will feel miserable at the moment, but in the end you will reap the rewards in the form of greater gains or personal satisfaction. Skip out on those reps and you will be left with feeling the initial relief, followed by regret as you wonder what it would have been like had you just waited a bit longer. I see it as a form of delayed gratification because the food just tastes *that much better* having to work for it. Needless to say, I got myself some ramen.
